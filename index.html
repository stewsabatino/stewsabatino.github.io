                    It is great to meet you! I am Stew Sabatino and I live in New Lenox IL.
                    I graduated college at Southern Illinois University Carbondale with a 
                    mining engineering degree. From there I took my talents to become a 
                    supervisor for a aggregate mining company. I eventually went on to become 
                    a project manager and a plant manager. During this time, I realized that 
                    my true passion is in the tech industry, specifically in software
                    development.
                    I am now taking a full stack coding bootcamp through Northwestern
                    University to get into a career of software development.
                    I have a wife and dog at home.
